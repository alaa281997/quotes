# Lab 8 OO Design and GSON

> In this Application we need to use json file depend on our object, so we need to use GSON:
>Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation.
> 
> The app should showing the quote and the author when it is run and choose one quote each time it is run.
> 
# Lab: 09 - Web requests

> In this lab we need to get data from api that retrieve quotes
and it should save it in json file.
>
> FileWriter file = new FileWriter("C:\\Users\\User\\IdeaProjects\\quotes\\app\\src\\main\\java\\quotes\\quotesTest.json",true);
> here we read the json file
>
> URL url = new URL("http://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes");
> this is api url that have multiple quotes, I use it to render quotes.
>
> Some of results:
>
> Quote from API: ["Cultivating a manly musk puts opponent on notice."],
> Quote from API: ["Tom put all my records into this rectangle!"]


> Test:
>
> testAPI() : for test endpoints if work or not
> testFunctionality() : check if will get random quote from json file
> 

> *In this lab me and Amara AlBalkhi we share our ideas together to solve it in the best solutions*
